# `throw` Statement in JavaScript

The `throw` statement in JavaScript is used to create and handle custom errors. By using `throw`, you can generate exceptions, which can then be caught and handled using `try...catch` blocks. This is useful for managing errors and implementing robust error-handling mechanisms in your code.

## Syntax

```javascript
throw expression;
```

The expression can be any valid JavaScript expression. However, it's common to throw an instance of the Error object or one of its subclasses.

## Throwing Different Types of Errors

JavaScript has several built-in error types that can be used with `throw`:

- **Error:** A generic error.
- **SyntaxError:** Thrown when a syntax error occurs.
- **TypeError:** Thrown when a value is not of the expected type.
- **RangeError:** Thrown when a number is out of range.
- **ReferenceError:** Thrown when a non-existent variable is referenced
